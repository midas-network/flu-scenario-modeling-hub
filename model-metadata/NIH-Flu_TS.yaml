methods: "Seasonal ARIMA model with exogenous covariates for vaccination coverage, vaccine effectiveness, IAV subtype circulation, and influenza transmission rates."
methods_long: "We model flu hospitalizations in each location using dynamic harmonic regression with ARMA errors and exogenous covariates for vaccination, flu virus subtype circulation, and influenza transmission rates. To calibrate models, we use 4-10 years of historical data (depending on the location), including influenza-coded hospitalizations, outpatient influenza-like illness rates, IAV subtype circulation, 1-2 week lagged flu 'infections' (inferred from Rt estimation), and vaccine coverage and effectiveness. To estimate weekly Rt, we fit semi-mechanistic Bayesian epidemic models to observed ILI+ (ILI x % positive) rates."
