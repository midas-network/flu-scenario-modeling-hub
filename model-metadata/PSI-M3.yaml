methods_long: >
  For each state/territory our scenario projections are generated using a mechanistic model with S[Sv]I[Iv]HR 
  compartments, where 'v' subscripts indicate vaccinated and each compartment is age-stratified. We use the 
  vaccine time series provided by the Scenario Hub and assume that the infection-susceptibility of 
  vaccinated individuals is reduced by one half of vaccine effectiveness.  The vaccinated population experiences 
  waning VE by trickling vaccinated individuals from Sv back to S during the course of a season.  The model is 
  calibrated to 2022-2025 data using an iterative GMM resampling of parameter space with a uniform prior.  Projections
  for each state are produced using a combination of a historic distribution all states seasonal per-capita burdens, 
  the state's relative historic burden, the state's initial proportion Susceptible (as estimated by the calibration),
  and the seasonal forcing function (also estimated by the calibration).  National projection trajectories are 
  generated as the aggregate of state trajectories.  This aggregation is done using our error-correlation procedure, 
  ordered by peak week—insuring that some timing-coherence is maintained when selecting state trajectories to sum.
