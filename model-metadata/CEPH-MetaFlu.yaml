methods: "Age-structured ordinary differential equations model"
methods_long: "The model framework is based on ordinary differential equations and age-stratified contact matrices derived from both macro (census) and micro (survey) data sources. Flu transmissibility follows a seasonal pattern which is calibrated using hospitalization data from NHSN for the 2022-2023, 2023-2024 and 2024-2025 seasons. Furthermore, our model uses age-dependent infection-to-hospitalization risks, whose posterior distribution is estimated by our optimization procedure and their prior distribution is based on Flu literature."
