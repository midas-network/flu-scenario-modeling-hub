# Model Assumptions
## Immunity assumptions
FILL

### Number/type of immune classes considered
FILL

### Initial proportion of population with residual immunity from previous infections and previous seasonal vaccinations at the start of the 2025-26 season. 
FILL

### How is variability in this parameter engineered, if any?
FILL

### Initial proportion of population with residual immunity from previous infections and previous seasonal vaccinations at the start of the 2025-26 season.
FILL

### Waning immunity throughout the season (yes, no, differs for vaccination and natural infection)
FILL

## Details on Influenza Strain(s)
### Number of strains/subtypes included in model
FILL

### Strain(s) specifications (immune escape, transmissibility)
FILL

### Are interactions between strains/subtypes implicitly modeled?
FILL

## Seasonality implementation
FILL

## Initial Conditions
FILL

### Details on circulating strains at the start of the projection period
FILL

## Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs)
FILL

## Age Group Variability
### No of age groups
FILL

### Age-stratification differences (susceptibility, vaccine effectiveness, waning)
FILL

## State-level Variability
### State-stratification details (prior immunity, vaccine coverage)
FILL

## Vaccine Effectiveness
### VE against infection (by age, if relevant)
FILL

### VE against mortality (by age, if relevant)
FILL

### VE against transmission (by age, if relevant)
FILL

### Is the vaccine modeled a leaky or all-of-nothing (if relevant)
FILL 

### Summarize how uncertainty is generated within a single scenario. 1. Is there resampling of model parameters, and if so which parameters? 2. Is there additional stochasticity in the model, beyond parameter sampling?
